# Maximum Depth Of Binary Tree

To find the maximum depth of a binary tree, we need to traverse the tree and keep track of the depth at each node. We can solve this problem using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

The maxDepth function takes the root node of the binary tree as input and returns the maximum depth of the tree.

In this implementation, we start by checking if the root node is None. If it is, then the tree is empty, and the depth is 0.

Otherwise, we recursively calculate the maximum depth of the left and right subtrees by calling the (maxDepth) function on the left and right child nodes of the current node. The maximum depth of a subtree is the maximum depth among its left and right subtrees, plus 1 for the current node.

Finally, we return the maximum depth of the entire tree.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, as we visit each node once.

The auxiliary space required by this solution is O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree can be equal to the number of nodes, resulting in O(N) space complexity.
